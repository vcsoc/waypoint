"""
A2A registration helpers for the Waypoint proxy.

- ``discovery``: fetches the upstream agent's well-known card so the UI can
  display its skills/capabilities for the user to pick from.
- ``agent_card``: pure merge logic that builds the Waypoint-fronted agent card
  from the upstream card + the values the user set in the UI.
- ``endpoints``: FastAPI routes that wire the above into the proxy.
