        Anyone who can reach the gateway can call this server without a Waypoint key. The caller&apos;s Authorization
        header is forwarded to the upstream verbatim, per-key and per-team rate limits and spend tracking do not apply,
        and the upstream is fully responsible for authenticating callers. Choose OAuth Delegate instead if callers
        should still authenticate to Waypoint.
