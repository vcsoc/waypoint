# Testing for `waypoint/`

This directory 1:1 maps the the `waypoint/` directory, and can only contain mocked tests.

The point of this is to:
1. Increase test coverage of `waypoint/`
2. Make it easy for contributors to add tests for the `waypoint/` package and easily run tests without needing LLM API keys.


## File name conventions

- `waypoint/proxy/test_caching_routes.py` maps to `waypoint/proxy/caching_routes.py`
- `test_<filename>.py` maps to `waypoint/<filename>.py`
